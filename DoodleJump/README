DoodleJump README

Overview:
	For this project I made a paneorganizer class, a game class, a doodle class, a platform class, and a constants
	class. My game class was a subclass of paneorganizer and doodle and platform were subclasses of game. My paneorganizer
	handled where things were positioned on the screen, the game handler handled the logic, and the doodle and platform created the doodle and platform
	and then had a bunch of methods that I was able to use in the game class. I specified most of these specifics with my comments in each class.

Design Choices:
	Ok I made a lot of design choices haha.
	So first of all, each time the game starts, the doodle will have a new different color for both the head and the body.
	Every platform will also have a random color. 
	I imported a background image which is the original doodle jump image. 
	My game keeps track of the score based on when the doodle bounces on a platform.
	My shape is a composite image since it is a circle and a rectangle.
	That is all :P
	

Known Bugs:
